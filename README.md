 # Movie Matchup

 App developed during the Modern JavaScript Bootcamp by Colt Steele. This app compares any two movies to see which won more awards, took in more money at the box office, had better critic and user scores, using the OMDb API. 
 
 Created a re-useable custom autocomplete function to use with the search engine.
